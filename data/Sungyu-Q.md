# Consider implementing two-step procedure for updating protocol owners

A simple copy-paste error or a typo may end up bricking the protocol, by either setting the owner to a malicious address, setting the owner to a contract without the ability to perform key ownership functions, or setting the owner to an address with no known private keys. Implementing a two-step procedure for updating protocol ownership roles helps protect the protocol from human errors. Consider implementing a two-step procedure for updating ownership where the recipient is set as pending, and must accept the role of ownership by making an affirmative call.
